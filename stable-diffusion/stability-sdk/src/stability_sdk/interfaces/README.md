Api-Interfaces is the gRPC protocol for communication between the
[api-bridge](https://github.com/Stability-AI/api-bridge), the [api-web](https://github.com/Stability-AI/api-web),
and the [generator_server](https://github.com/Stability-AI/generator_server). Additionally, any
other client application communicating directly with `api-web` also use the interfaces generated

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you an environment setup to build the interface files from the proto source files.

### Prerequisites

The following items are needed to develop api-interfaces:
<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
>>>>>>> 917d866 (test)
- [golang](https://go.dev/) >= 1.18
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 16.16.0
- [cmake](https://cmake.org/) >= 3.14
- [protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf#protocol-compiler-installation)
- [grpc](https://grpc.io/)

It is recommended to use ssh cloning with this project for `git` and for `go get`, although `https`
does appear to work. To force ssh (for github) put the following in your `.gitconfig`:

```ini
[url "ssh://git@github.com/"]
  insteadOf = https://github.com/
```

### Setup and building

After all the prerequisites are installed and available, this project can be setup by the following:

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:Stability-AI/api-interfaces.git
cd api-interfaces
cmake .
cmake --build .
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
This will produce files for the various languages in [gooseai](./gooseai) to support the proto
files in [src](./src). _When rebuilding the files it is recommended to do a clean before as there
have been instances of not all files being regenerated without it._

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

The generated files are all output in [gooseai](./gooseai). How to use these files depends on the
programming language being used. The following sections provide details for each of the supported
languages.

The files have different usages and not all are required depending on the situation:
| Suffix | Client | Server |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| \_grpc_pb | ‚úîÔ∏è1 | ‚úîÔ∏è |
| \_pb_service | ‚úîÔ∏è2 | |
| \_pb | ‚úîÔ∏è | ‚úîÔ∏è |

To use them make sure the files are on the python path.

### Other Languages / Custom Build

If not using the CMake defined builds to generate make sure when building from the source proto
files that the following proto include paths are set:
